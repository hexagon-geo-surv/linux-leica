FPGA Area

Alan Tull 2015

Overview
========

An FPGA Area details information about a section of an FPGA including the FPGA
image needed to program it and the hardware contained once it is programmed.

Loading a Device Tree overlay which contains an FPGA Area will cause the
FPGA to be programmed and the children of the FPGA Area will get probed.

There may be FPGA Bridges involved to prevent spurious data from going out onto
the processor bus during FPGA programming.  If so, the FPGA Area will need to
disable and enable bridges that will only affect the child devices that are
below the FPGA Area.  In the case of partial reconfiguration, bridges will
be required within the FPGA design such that the active sections of the
FPGA are on the bus while sections that are not programmed or being
reprogrammed at the moment are isolated.

Removing the overlay will result in the child devices getting removed and the
bridges disabled.  Note that in the case of partial reconfiguration the rest of
the FPGA continues to function as normal while this is happening.

Below are more details on the structuring of the Device Tree for this.

Terminology
===========

Full Reconfiguration
 * The entire FPGA is reprogrammed.

Partial Reconfiguration (PR)
 * Part of the FPGA is reprogrammed while the rest of the FPGA is live and
   active.  Not all FPGA's support this.

Associated Blocks
=================

FPGA Manager Framework
 * An FPGA Manager is a hardware block that programs an FPGA under the control
   of a host processor.
 * The FPGA Manager Framework provides drivers and functions to program an
   FPGA.

FPGA Bridge Framework
 * Provides drivers and functions to control bridges that enable/disable
   data to the FPGA.
 * FPGA bridges should be disabled while the FPGA is being programmed to
   prevent spurious data on the bus.
 * FPGA bridges are not needed in implementations where the FPGA Manager
   handles this.

Device Tree
===========

For the purposes of this document, I'm dividing the Device Tree (DT) into two parts,
each with its own requirements.  The two parts are:
 * The live DT prior to the overlay being added
 * The overlay containing an FPGA Area

The live DT will contain:
 * FPGA Manager
 * FPGA Bridges as children of the FPGA Manager (optional, architecture specific)

The live Device Tree must contain an FPGA Manager to handle programming the FPGA.
If FPGA Bridges need to be involved, they show up in the DT as direct children
of the FPGA Manager.  During full reconfiguration, the FPGA Area will disable
any bridges that are direct children of the manager during full reconfiguration
and will re-enable them afterwards.

The insertion point in the live tree will also need the "simple-bus"
compatibility string to enable populating the child nodes for the overlay.
That includes the nodes for the FPGA Manager and controlling FPGA Bridges
as explained below.

The Device Tree Overlay will contain:
 * "target-path"
   The insertion point where the the contents of the overlay will go into the
   live tree.
 * "ranges"
 * "firmware-name"
   Specifies the name of the FPGA image file on the firmware search
   path.  The search path is described in the firmware class documentation.
 * "partial-reconfig"
   This binding is a boolean and should be present if partial reconfiguration
   is to be done.
 * child nodes corresponding to hardware that will be loaded in this
   region of the FPGA.

Supported use models
====================

Here's a list of the superset of supported use models.  We may need to add
more.  Some uses are specific to one FPGA or another.

 * No FPGA Bridges
   In this case, the FPGA Manager which programs the FPGA also handles the
   bridges and no FPGA Bridge devices are needed for full reconfiguration.

   The DT overlay will specify the FPGA Manager as the overlay target.

 * Full reconfiguration with bridges
   In the case, there are several bridges between the processor and FPGA,
   that need to be disabled during full reconfiguration.
   The DT before the overlay is applied will have an FPGA Manager.  The
   immediate children of the manager will be the FPGA Bridges that need to be
   disabled during FPGA programming.

   The DT overlay will specify one of those bridges as the overlay target,
   typically the bridge that allows memory mapped register access ("the
   controlling bridge").

 * Partial reconfiguration with bridges in the FPGA
   In this case, the FPGA can have more than one section that will be
   reprogrammed separately.  Other sections may be active on the bus while FPGA
   is being programmed.  To manage this, FPGA Bridges need to exist on the FPGA
   that can freeze all the buses going to one FPGA area while the buses are
   enabled for other sections.

Controlling Bridge
==================

It is possible that there are multiple FPGA Bridges connecting the processor
and FPGA.  In a text based hierarchy, it is difficult to show this properly
so what we do is consider the bridge that handles register access to be
the controlling bridge.  The overlay is targeted to be inserted under the
controlling bridge.  Other bridges are on the same level of the device tree
as the controlling bridge, i.e. all are children of the FPGA Manager.  The
ranges property handles mapping memory ranges through multiple bridges.

Sequence
========

Load the DT overlay.  One way to do that from user space is to use Pantelis
Antoniou's DT-Overlay configfs interface.  In that case the sequence from
userspace is:

 $ mkdir /config/device-tree/overlays/1
 $ echo "some_overlay.dtb.o" > /config/device-tree/overlays/1/path

This causes the FPGA Area to be probed and will do the following:
 1. Disable the FPGA bridges.
 2. Use the the FPGA manager core to program the FPGA.
 3. Enable the FPGA bridges.
 4. Call of_platform_populate resulting in device drivers getting probed.

Removing the overlay is done by:

 $ rmdir /config/device-tree/overlays/1

This causes the child nodes to be removed and then the bridges are disabled.

Device Tree Examples
====================

The intention of this section is to give some simple examples, focusing on
the placement of the elements detailed above in, especially:
 * FPGA Managers
 * FPGA Bridges in some cases
 * FPGA Areas and associated properties
 * simple-bus
 * ranges
 * target-path

Please note the "simple-bus" compatible string added for FPGA Managers and for
FPGA Bridges where the overlay is targeted for insertion.  This is required for
populating the child nodes.
