U-Boot bootcount driver

This driver implements the Linux kernel half of the boot count feature -
the boot counter can only be reset after it is clear that the
application has been started and is running correctly, which usually
can only be determined by the application code itself. Thus the reset
of the boot counter must be done by application code, which thus needs
an appropriate driver.

Required feature by the Carrier Grade Linux Requirements Definition;
see for example document "Carrier Grade Linux Requirements Definition
Overview V3.0" at

http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/cgl/requirements#SMM.6.0_Boot_Cycle_Detection

        Description: OSDL CGL specifies that carrier grade Linux
        shall provide support for detecting a repeating reboot cycle
        due to recurring failures. This detection should happen in
        user space before system services are started.

This driver provides read/write access to the U-Boot bootcounter
through sysFS file.

Currently memory type only supported.

Required properties:

  - compatible : should be "uboot,bootcount"
  - reg: the address of the bootcounter

Example:

bootcount@1c23000 {
	compatible = "uboot,bootcount";
	reg = <0x23060 0x20>;
};
