Altera SoCFPGA NAND Flash Controller FIFOs Error Detection and Correction [EDAC]

The Altera Arria 10 NAND flash controller has three local SRAM memory buffers:
the write FIFO buffer, the read FIFO buffer and the ECC buffer.
Each of these memories is protected by error checking and correction (ECC),
and by interrupts for single and double-bit errors.

NAND ECC Required Properties:
- compatible : Should be "altr,a10-nand-buf-edac" for the ECC buffer
	or "altr,a10-nand-rd-edac" for the read FIFO buffer
	or "altr,a10-nand-wr-edac" for the write FIFO buffer.
- reg : Address and size for ECC error interrupt status and clear registers.
- interrupts : Should be single bit error interrupt, then double bit error
	interrupt.

Example:
	nandedac_buf@ff8c2000 {
		compatible = "altr,a10-nand-buf-edac";
		reg = <0xff8c2000 0x400>;
		interrupts = <0 2 4>, <0 0 4>;
	};

	nandedac_rd@ff8c2400 {
		compatible = "altr,a10-nand-rd-edac";
		reg = <0xff8c2400 0x400>;
		interrupts = <0 2 4>, <0 0 4>;
	};

	nandedac_wr@ff8c2800 {
		compatible = "altr,a10-nand-wr-edac";
		reg = <0xff8c2800 0x400>;
		interrupts = <0 2 4>, <0 0 4>;
	};
