/*
 * Printk console printing implementation for consoles which does not depend
 * on the legacy style console_lock mechanism.
 *
 * The state of the console is maintained in the "nbcon_state" atomic
 * variable.
 *
 * The console is locked when:
 *
 *   - The 'prio' field contains the priority of the context that owns the
 *     console. Only higher priority contexts are allowed to take over the
 *     lock. A value of 0 (NBCON_PRIO_NONE) means the console is not locked.
 *
 *   - The 'cpu' field denotes on which CPU the console is locked. It is used
 *     to prevent busy waiting on the same CPU. Also it informs the lock owner
 *     that it has lost the lock in a more complex scenario when the lock was
 *     taken over by a higher priority context, released, and taken on another
 *     CPU with the same priority as the interrupted owner.
 *
 * The acquire mechanism uses a few more fields:
 *
 *   - The 'req_prio' field is used by the handover approach to make the
 *     current owner aware that there is a context with a higher priority
 *     waiting for the friendly handover.
 *
 *   - The 'unsafe' field allows to take over the console in a safe way in the
 *     middle of emitting a message. The field is set only when accessing some
 *     shared resources or when the console device is manipulated. It can be
 *     cleared, for example, after emitting one character when the console
 *     device is in a consistent state.
 *
 *   - The 'unsafe_takeover' field is set when a hostile takeover took the
 *     console in an unsafe state. The console will stay in the unsafe state
 *     until re-initialized.
 *
 * The acquire mechanism uses three approaches:
 *
 *   1) Direct acquire when the console is not owned or is owned by a lower
 *      priority context and is in a safe state.
 *
 *   2) Friendly handover mechanism uses a request/grant handshake. It is used
 *      when the current owner has lower priority and the console is in an
 *      unsafe state.
 *
 *      The requesting context:
 *
 *        a) Sets its priority into the 'req_prio' field.
 *
 *        b) Waits (with a timeout) for the owning context to unlock the
 *           console.
 *
 *        c) Takes the lock and clears the 'req_prio' field.
 *
 *      The owning context:
 *
 *        a) Observes the 'req_prio' field set on exit from the unsafe
 *           console state.
 *
 *        b) Gives up console ownership by clearing the 'prio' field.
 *
 *   3) Unsafe hostile takeover allows to take over the lock even when the
 *      console is an unsafe state. It is used only in panic() by the final
 *      attempt to flush consoles in a try and hope mode.
 *
 * The release function simply clears the 'prio' field.
 *
 * All operations on @console::nbcon_state are atomic cmpxchg based to
 * handle concurrency.
 *
 * The acquire/release functions implement only minimal policies:
 *
 *   - Preference for higher priority contexts.
 *   - Protection of the panic CPU.
 *
 * All other policy decisions must be made at the call sites:
 *
 *   - What is marked as an unsafe section.
 *   - Whether to spin-wait if there is already an owner and the console is
 *     in an unsafe state.
 *   - Whether to attempt an unsafe hostile takeover.
 *
 * The design allows to implement the well known:
 *
 *     acquire()
 *     output_one_printk_record()
 *     release()
 *
 * The output of one printk record might be interrupted with a higher priority
 * context. The new owner is supposed to reprint the entire interrupted record
 * from scratch.
