* Cadence Quad SPI controller

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "cdns,qspi-nor".
- reg : Contains two entries, each of which is a tuple consisting of a
	physical address and length.  The first entry is the address and
	length of the controller register set.  The second entry is the
	address and length of the QSPI Controller data area.
- interrupts : Unit interrupt specifier for the controller interrupt.
- clocks : phandle to the Quad SPI clock.
- fifo-depth : Size of the data FIFO in words.

Optional properties:
- is-decoded-cs : Flag to indicate whether decoder is used or not.

Optional subnodes:
Subnodes of the Cadence Quad SPI controller are spi slave nodes with additional
custom properties:
- cdns,page-size : Size, in bytes, of the device's write page
- cdns,block-size : Size of the device's erase block
- cdns,tshsl-ns : Delay in nanoseconds for the length that the master mode chip select outputs are de-asserted between transactions.
- cdns,tsd2d-ns : Delay in nanoseconds between one chip select being de-activated and the activation of another.
- cdns,tchsh-ns : Delay in nanoseconds between last bit of current transaction and deasserting the device chip select (qspi_n_ss_out).
- cdns,tslch-ns : Delay in nanoseconds between setting qspi_n_ss_out low and first bit transfer.

Example:

	qspi: spi@ff705000 {
		compatible = "cdns,qspi-nor";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		reg = <0xff705000 0x1000>,
			<0xffa00000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 151 4>;
		clocks = <&qspi_clk>;
		is-decoded-cs = <1>;
		fifo-depth = <128>;

		flash0: n25q00@0 {
			...
			cdns,page-size = <256>;
			cdns,block-size = <16>;
			cdns,read-delay = <4>;
			cdns,tshsl-ns = <50>;
			cdns,tsd2d-ns = <50>;
			cdns,tchsh-ns = <4>;
			cdns,tslch-ns = <4>;
		}
	}
