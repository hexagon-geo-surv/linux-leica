Required properties:
- compatible		: Should contain "altr,socfpga-fpga2sdram-bridge"

Optional properties:
- bridge-enable		: 0 if driver should disable bridge at startup
			  1 if driver should enable bridge at startup
			  Default is to leave bridge in current state.

Example:
	fpga2sdram_br {
		compatible = "altr,socfpga-fpga2sdram-bridge";
		bridge-enable = <0>;
	};
